# Disease Identification
<p align="justify">Disease Identification is end-to-end image classification project that allow user to identify a disease in a plant leaf by giving the leaf image to the system. The System will identify the disease using ResNet50 model where the model accuracy reaches 86.12% (we do model training for maize and rice leaves). After the system get the disease, the result will be used to perform a query select on the data to get treatment and pesticide recommendations for the plant. For pesticide recommendation, farmer can select and compare with pesticide is easier to get at a lower price. We hope that this project can help Indonesian farmers in caring for crops. <b><i>This is just MVP product</i></b>, feel free to develop for feature improvement.</p>
